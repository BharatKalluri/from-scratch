## A simple rule

Let's first visualize a basic rule.

```python
facts = {'age': 19}
rule = Rule('age', 'gt', 18)
print(rule.run(facts)) # true 
```

To bring this to life, let's start by defining the `Rule` structure. Which takes in `fact_key`, `operator` & `value`. It'll have a `run` function which will just run the mathematical operation based on the operator.

```python
@dataclass
class Rule:
    fact_key: str | int
    operator: str
    value: str | int

    def run(self, facts):
        if self.operator == "gt":
            return facts.get(self.fact_key) > self.value
```

We'll add more operators going foreard. Now with this, running the rule would be simply running

```python
rule = Rule("age", "gt", 18)
print(rule.run(facts={"age": 19})) # true
print(rule.run(facts={"age": 18})) # false
```

Now to the next step, what does it take to build a `AndRule`?

## Building an `AndRule`

An `AndRule` takes in a list of rules, runs __all__ of those `Rule`s and returns the result.

```python
@dataclass
class AndRule:
    rules: list[Rule]

    def run(self, facts):
        return all([r.run(facts=facts) for r in self.rules])
```

now with this

```python
rule = AndRule([Rule("age", "gt", 18), Rule("country", "eq", "IN")])
print(rule.run(facts={"age": 19, "country": "IN"}))  # true
print(rule.run(facts={"age": 18, "country": "RU"}))  # false
```

Similarly, an `OrRule` can also work. Just that instead of using `all`, we'll be using `any`.

This marks a checkpoint, where the rule engine actually is entirely functional!

Now the question is about context, we know the result of the rule. But how do we understand why?

We'll need to propagate context upwards.
