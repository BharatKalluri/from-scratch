## JSON parser

JSON is used by developers day in and day out. Building a JSON parser from scratch is a fun experiment to learn about how to parsers work in general.

### Steps

We'll start by breaking the string into valid chunks, called tokens. This process removes all other cruft like new lines, spaces etc.. & then classifies them into classes of tokens. This is called tokenization or lexical analysis.

The next phase of the pipeline takes in the tokens and constructs a tree out of it. At this phase, the tree is validated and structured.

Let's start by breaking the raw string into structured tokens in the next chapter!
