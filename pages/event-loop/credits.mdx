This is a text rendition of [David beazley](https://www.dabeaz.com/)'s absolutely amazing talk titled [Writing your own async](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4Gt3Xjd7G8). With some extra explanations on places where I felt I could add more clarity.

This video has been the inspiration for starting this project. Please check out his courses and his content, he's a great teacher and an inspiration.
